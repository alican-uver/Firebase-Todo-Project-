- #### In this project, the application of authentication and updating data in real time was studied using firebase. By incorporating webpack and babel into the project, an es6 class-based coding is intended to be practical about their use. Efforts have been made to make the codes appear complex and readable. Except for the bootstrap grid system, the project interface is completely written in accordance with the 7-1 design pattern for SCSS users, and for the understanding of scss styling in itself.

### Todo for me: 
* The user added to do will be saved and made accessible later.
* I will add google and facebook authentication. 
* The firebase storage feature will be added.
* Information on when todo was added will be added and accessible.
